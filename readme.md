# Typemoji - Easier Emojis

Typemoji is a browser extension for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge that makes it much easier to type emojis. Simply type :sob : for ðŸ˜­ and so on. 

# How To Use
Typemoji will be publsihed on Chrome and Edge very soon, but for now, to use the extension, just download the 'source' folder (you don't really need the others) and load it unpacked. 

Have fun with it, and I'd love any feedback/criticism :)
