# Typemoji - Easier Emojis

Typemoji is a browser extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox that makes it much easier to type emojis. Simply type :sob : for ðŸ˜­ and so on. 

# How To Use
Typemoji will be publsihed on Firefox and Chrome very soon, but for now, to use the extension, just download the 'source' folder (you don't really need the others) and load it unpacked. 

Have fun with it, and I'd love any feedback/criticism :)
